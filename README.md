# Construction-Site-Safety-Gears-Detection
Safety gears detection of 10 different classes of construction site workers. This repo contains the custom object detection notebook, models, dataset, results using YoloV8. You can customize the training models with your own dataset using the notebook provided
# Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for training and deploying a deep learning model to detect and recognize construction safety gears in images and videos. The objective of this project was to detect the safety gears of constructio workers, so that it can be used in workers safety inspection, tracking and more. The model is trained to identify various safety gears such as hardhats, masks, safety vests, gloves, and safety boots, with the goal of promoting safety and compliance in construction sites.
# Features
*Training code for custom object detection using YoloV8.

*Pretrained models for construction safety gear detection.

*Dataset preparation and augmentation scripts.

*Inference code for real-time detection on images, videos, and webcam feeds.

*Evaluation metrics and visualization tools.
# Setup
The code was run on Google Colab, with a T4 GPU. We installed #ultralytics library
